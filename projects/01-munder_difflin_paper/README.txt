Project
Munder Difflin Paper

Description
First individual project during Web-Development Fellowship at New York Code and Design Academy.
It is an one-page website for a fictional paper company that is exciting for the end user and
provides information about company's services.

Requirements
The requirements for completing this project are:
- be one page
- have HTML tags be semantically relevant to the content it contains
- have at least one useful animation on the page
- have at least one useful javascript event callback (click, hover, keydown, etc)

Motivation
This project had two objectives: meeting the set requirements and practicing CSS. That's why I tried
to implement and try different approaches and techniques in CSS (grid vs flex display etc). 

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JS

Features
The key features are:
- fixed position of the header keeps it on top of the page regardless of scrolling;
- background-attachment: fixed style property allows for the background image in the main section to remain fixed while scrolling;
- min-height: 85vh style prooperty allows the section to be sized depending on the window size;
- JS DOM is used to enlarge services icons and reveal additional text;
- auto slideshow is implemented in testimonials section with the help of JS
- linear-gradient CSS property makes the background picture of the testimonials sections to be not too bright;
- custom fonts are loaded from google fonts;
- JS mouseover/mouseout functions use string concatenation to get the needed element ids;
